    Helper to test an API method -- returns a tuple of
    (test_api_client, check_assertions) where check_assertions will
    verify that the API method returned the data from http.request,
    and that http.request was called with the correct arguments.

    check_assertions' signature is:
    def check_assertions(object_returned_from_api,
                         # GET, POST, etc.

                         expected_headers)

    is correctly hooked up to http.request():

        client, check_assertions = check_client_method()
        result = client.Org.get_all()
        check_assertions(result, 'GET', '/org/')
